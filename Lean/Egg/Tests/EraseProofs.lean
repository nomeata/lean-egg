-- The following test is an attempt to construct a rewrite where the mvar `x` does appear in the
-- proof term on the rhs, but not in the *type* of the proof term. If this succeeded, proof erasure
-- should cause a crash during variable substitution after e-matching, as proofs are encoded by
-- their type, which is therefore missing the mvar for `x`. But obviously, the rewrite `h` does not
-- achieve this yet.
